<h2 align="center">Description</h2>
<p align="justify">
<b>HomeFlow</b> is a friendly and collaborative Chore Task Manager. You create your own **family** and starts adding chores to do. Every member of a family contribute to the effort and generate a lovely garden that everyone needs to maintain by doing their tasks.
</p>

<h2 align="center">UI</h2>
<p align="justify">
The interface was designed to reduce the typing. Every category and task is an icon that can be added to the to-do list. There is a default database that comes within the app but you can create you own as well (Here you'll have some typing to do ðŸ˜‰).
</p>

<h2 align="justify">Features</h2>
<p align="justify">
The app contains the following features:

- Categories and tasks are displayed as Icons to speed up the addition of new tasks.
- It is possible to create custom categories and tasks, thus creating a user database.
- Progress can be reviewed daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.
- Calendar helps to create a task for a specific day or review the ones done or to be completed.
- As long as the members complete their tasks, the family garden is maintained alive.
